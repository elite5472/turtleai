Turtle AI
=========

Turtle AI is a project to develop turtles that leverage the BDI (Beliefs, Desires, Intentions) planning model to aid the player with numerous tasks.

The project uses make.rb to dynamically prepare lua scripts for use within ComputerCraft. The pastebin commands bellow are dynamically updated.

```yaml

turn.lua: pastebin get Q1BSEcEL turn

```
